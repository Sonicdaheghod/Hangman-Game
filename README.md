# Chemistry Terms Hangman Game

## Purpose of this Program

This hangman game I coded is intended for high school students to study their chemistry terms in a entertaining and educational way. 
Python was used to create the bulk of the program (game functionality, word bank) and ASCII art was used to create my rendition of "Nanopuritan"
